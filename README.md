# Quantum matching pursuit

This repo contains the core code of the experiments of the quantum matching pursuit algorithm.

`quantumMatchPurs.py` contains the classical matching pursuit algorithm, modified to introduce errors in the computation of the inner products.

`create_data.py` is a script that can be used to collect the data of multiple instances of the experiment.

Using the data generated from this code it is possible to reproduce the analysis of our work.
